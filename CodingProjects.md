# Includes the project ideas and Plans that I have. 

1. I want to create some sort of automatic telegram channel content downloader, meaning if there is something that I want from a channel to be downloaded
   it should download it automatically. 
2. Fuzzy search enabled notes manager and synchronisations, that will totally be helpful if merged with bookmarks

* iterfzf for fuzzy finding
* git for synchronisation 
* xsel or something similar for clipboard

1. Automatic mount with rclone and having some good speed 
4. An automated script for the automation of scenarios in MPTCP
